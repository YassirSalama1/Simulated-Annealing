This is our implementation of the simulated annealing approach to calculate the bandwidth of a graph.  

You can input a graph in the following format :  
N M  
A1 B1  
A2 B2  
...  
AM BM  

With N : number of nodes; M : number of edges; (Ai,Bi) : the i-th edge.  

You can adjust the tle variable to change the time limit of execution. Note that this is a heuristic algorithm. So if you choose small values it might not give the right answer.
